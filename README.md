# MergeSort
Merge sort created in C using Piping. 

This project was done as part of my Operating Systems class. 

After compiling mergeSort.c, and a.out file will be generated. To run the projcet, you must specify how many integers will be sorted at runtime. 

EX: ./a.out 5

Then, the program will parse from stdin. It accepts files, or raw numerical data to be sorted. 

NOTE: If you are giving the program a file, you still must specify how many integers are in the file at runtime.
